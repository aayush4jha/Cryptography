# 🔐 Cryptography

## 📘 Introduction

Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into a format that is unreadable to unauthorized users. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of data in digital communication. From classical ciphers to modern encryption algorithms, cryptography forms the backbone of secure systems in the digital world.
